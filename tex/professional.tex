\item[] \textit{Lead Test Engineer, Guidance, Navigation, \& Control Group \\
    Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RVSVC)}%
    \hfill {Aug~2011-Sep~2014}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Directed a 6 member team in developing orbit determination software and designing an observation campaign for the ANGELS flight experiment.
    An Unscented Kalman Filter~(UKF) was developed to verify and validate the performance of a GPS receiver in geostationary orbit.
    Additionally, a ground based collection strategy, incorporating AFSSN sensors, was developed and tested on operational satellites.
    The AFRL ANGELS vehicle launched in 2014 to advance autonomous rendezvous and proximity operation control algorithms.
    The UKF and ground based observation campaign was critical for accurate navigation and allowed for more aggressive maneuvers. 
    \item Designed custom astrodynamics force model for the ANGLES flight experiment.
    Incorporated the effects of solar radiation pressure, attitude control actuators and sensors, Earth gravitational models, and thruster uncertainties to predict the expected performance of the spacecraft.
    Analysis predicted a coupling between rotational and translational motion during angular momentum desaturation burns.
    A orientation profile was developed which minimized the accumulation of undesired angular momentum and allowed for extended quiescent periods in support of orbit determination activities.
    \item Led \$5M lab development program to develop an in situ attitude dynamics and control simulator.  
    Responsible for procurement, design, and integration of the largest spherical air-bearing platform in the world.
    Developed software to interface with inertial measurement units, motion capture systems, and control hardware to allow for hardware in the loop system testing.
    The facility is currently being used to validate future flight attitude control actuators and algorithms. 
    \item Developed a method for space based geolocation via time difference of arrival signals.
    Implemented geometric techniques to develop a closed form analytical solution to locate a noncooperative electromagnetic signal based on the time of arrival to a formation of satellites.
    \item Led the development of a satellite relative motion simulator using embedded ground based robotic systems.
    Designed the software to allow for accurate scaling and simulation of spacecraft motion.
    Directly implemented a motion capture system on embedded hardware to allow for accurate positioning and control. 
    \item Managed \$4M DARPA space situational awareness contract by leading diverse team of academia, industry, and government in an effort to develop integrated orbit determination software.
